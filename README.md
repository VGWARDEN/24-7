# 24/7 Terminal Activity Script

## Description

This script keeps the terminal active **24/7** by performing continuous file operations such as creating, editing, and deleting files in rapid cycles.

Made by **VGWARDEN**.

## How It Works

The script runs in the terminal indefinitely, generating random files, editing them, and deleting them every few seconds, ensuring the terminal stays active.
