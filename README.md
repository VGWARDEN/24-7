# 24/7 Terminal Activity Script

## Description

This script creates a dynamic and active terminal environment by executing various file operations every 5 seconds, ensuring the terminal remains engaged **24/7**. It generates files with random content, edits them, and deletes them in a rapid cycle, keeping the terminal continuously active.

The script also displays a custom banner on startup with the **VGWARDEN** branding.

## How It Works

1. **File Creation**: Generates files with random names and random content (between 10 and 100 lines, each line containing 100 characters).
2. **File Editing**: After a brief delay, the file is overwritten with new random content.
3. **File Deletion**: The file is deleted after a short period, completing the cycle.
4. **24/7 Cycle**: This process repeats every 5 seconds, ensuring the terminal is kept active.
